Quality records are controlled documents that provide measurable evidence that the DreamBig software/product meets its stated requirements and objectives.
As part of ISO 9001 the preparation, storage, retrieval, and disposal of quality records should all be defined by documentation procedures.

**Purpose of Quality Records**
The purpose of managing quality records is to:
- Assure the quality of document
- Assure compliance with document structure procedures Eg. Using templates
- Assure future availability of documents that can be used for software maintenance, further development, investigation of software failures or unmet requirements.

DreamBig quality record templates currently include:
- Requirements traceability matrix
- Test case template
- QA Status report
- Customer satisfaction survey

It is the responsibility of DreamBig documentation and QA team members to create, modify and update quality record templates. The quality record templates will then be available for all DreamBig members to record their results and save the records to github where they can be viewed by the relevant stakeholders.

**Document storage and retrieval**
Quality records will be stored in the DreamBig github documentation templates (https://github.com/thoth-tech/DreamBig-Project/blob/main/Documentation/Templates) folder and made available to all students with access to the Toth Tech Dreambig documentation to view as required. Revisions to document templates may overwrite existing templates and the github document control will record latest commit, unique identifier, and team member who has modified the document.

Each quality record document that is produced as a template or a record of testing should have a defined structure (free or defined by a template), a unique identifier with version/revision number, reference information (author, date of completion, changes introduced in version).
As Thoth Tech is using github for document management purposes, team members will be required to push the document to the github location and seek approval from the appropriate Thoth Tech member in order to complete the push. Github will provide the appropriate document revision management and the team member can provide remarks as required when creating push request.

Document Retention
Quality records should be stored for the entirety of the DreamBig project including during design, implementation, and maintenance phases and will be stored as a reference for future project phases and troubleshooting.
